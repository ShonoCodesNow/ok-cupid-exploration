# ok-cupid-exploration
In this portfolio project, you will analyze some data from OKCupid, an app that focuses on using multiple choice and short answers to match users.  You will also create a presentation about your findings from this OKCupid dataset.  The purpose of this project is to practice formulating questions and implementing machine learning techniques to answer those questions. However, the questions you ask and how you answer them are entirely up to you.
